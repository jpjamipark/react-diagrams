This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This is a simple, standalone demo of the `react-diagrams` library and a starting point for creating
a visual authoriing environment for neural networks.

## Get started

`yarn install`
then
`npm start` or `yarn run start`
